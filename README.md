Run "npm install" after cloning the repo locally.
Start the backend server located in the other repository. (it goes by the name Digital-Music-Library-Server).
Go to "src/utils/constants.ts" and change the IP adress to match the server's IP address, the port is set to 3001 on the server, but if you'd decide to change it make sure to change it in here aswell.
Go to the terminal and write "npm run dev" and the application should start.
